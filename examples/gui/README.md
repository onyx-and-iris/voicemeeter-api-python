## About

A single channel GUI demonstrating controls for the first virtual strip if Voicemeeter Banana.

This example demonstrates (to an extent) two way communication. 
-   Sending parameters values to the Voicemeeter driver.
-   Receiving level updates

Parameter updates (pdirty) events are not being received so changing a UI element on the main Voicemeeter app will not be reflected in the example GUI.

## Use

Simply run the script and try the controls.
